## 🧠 About me

I’m a Computer & Data Science student at the University of Toronto. I'm always trying to learn something new to help me approach problems with a new lens. 

I enjoy:
- Taking ambiguous problems and turning them into simple systems
- Owning projects end-to-end (design → code → deploy → iterate)
- Learning by building (and occasionally breaking things responsibly)

Currently:
- 💼 **Full Stack Developer @ Scotiabank (Global Banking & Markets)**
- 🛠 Building **ReturnFlow**, a Rails returns & exchanges platform
- 🏃‍♂️ Running (mostly from bugs, sometimes from my responsibilities)

---

## 🚧 What I’m building right now

### 🧾 ReturnFlow — Returns & Exchanges Platform (Rails)
A self-serve returns portal + merchant dashboard designed like a real commerce platform.

**Why I built it:**  
Because returns are messy, async, stateful, and full of edge cases — aka a great systems problem.

**Highlights**
- 🏬 Multi-tenant Rails 7 app (store-scoped data model)
- 🔁 Validated state transitions (requested → approved → received → refunded/exchanged)
- 🧾 Append-only event log for traceability & auditability
- ⚙️ Sidekiq + Redis for async jobs (notifications + webhooks)
- 🔐 Webhooks with HMAC signatures + retry/backoff
- 📊 Analytics on return reasons & SKU hotspots

> Think Shopify returns, but built in a hackathon-style sprint (with fewer meetings).

📦 Repo: *coming soon* (currently sprinting 🏃‍♂️)
